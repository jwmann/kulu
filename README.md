###### A better input source switcher for OS X

## TL;DR
Kulu helps users to switch between keyboard input sources by user-defined
shortcuts.

## A little background

I use 3 input sources in my Mac, `U.S.`, `2-Set Korean` and `Hiragana`. When
I used to use only 2 sources, it was just fine. I needed to just stroke `Command+Space`
to switch between them. However, when the other was added, it became a mess.

In order to switch an input source to another, `Command+Space` should be
stroked several times. It's mainly because it switches a source to a
previously-selected source, and usually we don't always remember what it was.
There's another built-in shortcut, `Alt+Command+Space`, which switch the input
to a next language in system order. However, the order should be memorised to
avoid always checking which language is current. Although we've memorised the
order perfectly, we need to stroke the keys more than twice if the sources
are not adjecent. In short, it's a hell.

I'd always thought I needed an app like Kulu before I accidently became into
Swift and decided to implement this by myself. I hope others can be helped
by Kulu and escape from the input switching hell.

Cheers!

## Demo

For better quality, there is a
[video version of this demo](http://vimeo.com/135542587) on Vimeo.

## Install

The prebuilt binaries can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/noraesae/kulu/releases).

Unzip `Kulu.zip` and move `Kulu.app` to `Applications`.

## Preferences

Preferences can be found in a preference window. The window can be opened by
clicking the menubar icon of Kulu or launching Kulu again.

* General Stuff
  * **`Show Menubar Icon`**  
    Show the icon of Kulu in the OS X menubar. When you click the icon, a
    preference window will be opened. If this option is unset, the icon will be
    hidden and the preference window can be opened when launching Kulu again.
  * **`Launch Kulu on startup`**  
    Add Kulu to startup items.
* Shortcut
  * **`Use an advanced method to switch input sources`**  
    There is a known problem when programminly switching between complex input
    sources such as [CJK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters)
    layouts. This option enables a workaround to fix the problem. In other words,
    if you find no problem using Kulu, please ignore this option. To use this
    option, the global shortcut of `Select next source in Input menu` should be
    set to `Alt+Command+Space`, which may be set by default. Unless the
    shortcut is set correctly and Kulu works as intended, you can check if the
    shortcut is set correctly in `System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts >
    Input Sources`.

## Development

We use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) as a dependency manager.
You can find the latest releases of Carthage [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases),
or just install it with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To clone the Git repository of Kulu and install dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:noraesae/kulu.git
$ carthage bootstrap
```

To open the Xcode project of Kulu:

```
$ open kulu.xcodeproj
```

You can surely open the project from Xcode.

Kulu can be built with the `Product` menu in Xcode as other Xcode projects
are built. If you prefer using command line, just run the build script.

```
$ ./build.sh
```

It will build the project and export `Kulu.app` to the project root.

## Help!

The application is quite simple and this README contains quite most of it. When
you have a problem using Kulu, I would recommend reading this README again,
carefully.

* [Install](#install)
* [Preferences](#preferences)
* [Development](#development)

If there's still a problem, please upload it as an issue on
[Issues](https://github.com/noraesae/kulu/issues).
